# DimagiProject

This is an application that allows users to enter in their location and have it saved on a database for integration with whereis.dimagi.com database.

The application takes in a city name, and then searches on an external API (api.geonames.org) to populate an entry with location information.

The following modules are required by the front-end:
  axios
  bulma
  bulma-toast
